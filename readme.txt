Very simple plugin for reliably inserting your Google Analytics tracking code on every page.

This is a bare bones option for people who are looking to simply insert the basic Google Analytics tracking code into the head section of every page. 

No crazy options, not very exciting, but works reliably.

1. Download the latest zip file and extract the `super-simple-google-analytics` directory.
2. Upload the this directory inside your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate 'Super Simple Google Analytics' on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Click 'Settings' underneath the plugin or navigate to Settings > Google Analytics and insert your GA tracking code and click the checkbox to turn it on.
5. That's it.
